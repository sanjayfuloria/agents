    "# Creating Multiple Agents - A Comprehensive Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide shows you how to create multiple agents across different AI frameworks and coordinate them effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating multiple agents opens up powerful possibilities for:\n",
    "- **Specialization**: Different agents can handle different domains or tasks\n",
    "- **Collaboration**: Agents can work together, review each other's work, and iterate\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Distribute workload across multiple agents\n",
    "- **Robustness**: Redundancy and different approaches to solving problems\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover multiple agent creation in:\n",
    "1. **AutoGen** - Dynamic agent creation and coordination\n",
    "2. **CrewAI** - Team-based collaboration\n",
    "3. **LangGraph** - Graph-based agent orchestration\n",
    "4. **OpenAI Agents SDK** - Structured multi-agent workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agent Coordination Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Sequential Pattern\n",
    "Agents work one after another in a pipeline:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Agent A → Agent B → Agent C → Result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Parallel Pattern  \n",
    "Agents work simultaneously on different aspects:\n",
    "```\n",
    "        Agent A\n",
    "Input →  Agent B → Combine → Result\n",
    "        Agent C\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Hierarchical Pattern\n",
    "Manager agent coordinates worker agents:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Manager Agent\n",
    "    ├── Worker Agent 1\n",
    "    ├── Worker Agent 2\n",
    "    └── Worker Agent 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Peer-to-Peer Pattern\n",
    "Agents communicate directly with each other:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Agent A ↔ Agent B\n",
    "    ↕       ↕\n",
    "Agent D ↔ Agent C\n",
    "```"

    "- Define clear inputs and expected outputs\n",

    "### 2. Communication Protocols\n",
    "- Establish how agents share information\n",
    "- Define message formats and handoff points\n",
    "- Handle failures and retries gracefully\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Start Simple**: Begin with 2-3 agents in a sequential workflow\n",
    "2. **Choose Your Framework**: Pick based on your specific needs and complexity\n",
    "3. **Define Clear Roles**: Make sure each agent has a distinct purpose\n",
    "4. **Test Incrementally**: Add agents and complexity gradually\n",
    "5. **Monitor and Iterate**: Track performance and refine your approach\n",

    "- Explore the existing examples in each framework directory\n",
    "- Try implementing one of the patterns above\n",
